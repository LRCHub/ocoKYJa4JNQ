Hello Americans, this is Klaus
from Common Denominator. That
is the band you are listening
to right now. We are from
Finland. This is the second
song on our debut album here in
America. This song is about the
words that connect subjects to
the predicate, help you forming
complete sentences. Your
helping verbs, aka your Linkin
Verbz. Linkin Verbz are such
that you should go buy the
record. This is the best song
on the record. You should go
buy a t-shirt. I would go buy a
t-shirt.
